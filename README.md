# Project 2 Description

## User Story

```AS A modern-day adventurer in search of treasure
I WANT an application that will allow me to view available bounties and their geographic locations
SO THAT I can get some fresh air and go on a treasure hunt
GIVEN a map interface application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for login information
THEN I can login with existing credentials or register
WHEN I am logged in
THEN I can view my profile, view a map of nearby geocaches, and create a new geocache
WHEN I am finished searching for hidden treasures
THEN I can log out of the application and end my session
WHEN I select a geocache to search for
THEN I am presented with information about it such as coordinates, title, size, and description
WHEN I find a geocache
THEN I can mark it in the app as "found" and add/update a "last found" date for the geocache
WHEN I am prompted to register or login
THEN I can enter a username, email, and password
WHEN I select navigate on a given geocache
THEN I am provided routing directions to it from my location
